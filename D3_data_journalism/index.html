          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Smoking and Obesity</h2>
          <p>As illustrated, there is a moderately positive relationship between obesity and smoking rates in a state population. That is to say, that if a state has a high proportion of smokers, then it will tend to have a high obesity rate as well. </p>

          <p>However, it should be noted that one does not cause the other. Possible outliers are Texas and Utah, which both have a low rate of smoking compared to the obesity rate. Potential low outliers are Colorado, Hawai'i, and District of Columbia (DC).  These show a lower level of obesity than the rate of smoking would suggest.  This implies that there are likely other factors causing both rates to rise or fall together. Since both smoking and obesity are known to be caused by lifestyle factors, an interesting look for further research would be to identify what makes the outliers different from the trend.</p>
